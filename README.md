========

A php implementation to send log-files to a gelf compatible backend like [Graylog2](http://graylog2.org/).
This library conforms to the PSR standards in regards to structure ([0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)),
coding-style ([1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md),
[2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md))
and logging ([3](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md)).

It's a loosely based on the original [Graylog2 gelf-php](https://github.com/Graylog2/gelf-php)
and [mlehner's fork](https://github.com/mlehner/gelf-php).

Stable release and deprecation of the original graylog2/gelf-php
----------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation became the official PHP GELF library on 2013-12-19 and is now released as `graylog2/gelf-php v1.0`.
The old library became deprecated at the same time and it's recommended to upgrade.

Since the deprecated library never got a stable release, we decided keep it available as `v0.1`. This means:
If you have a project based on the deprecated library but no time to upgrade to version 1.0, we recommend to change your
`composer.json` as following:

        "require": {
           // ...
           "graylog2/gelf-php": "0.1.*"
           // ...
        }

After running an additional `composer update` everything should work as expected.

Usage
-----

### Recommended installation via composer:

Add gelf-php to `composer.json`:

    "require": {
       // ...
       "graylog2/gelf-php": "~1.0"
       // ...
    }

Reinstall dependencies: `composer install`
